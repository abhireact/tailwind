    <p className='text-lg text-center text-gray-600'>API (Application Programming Interface) is the gateway that connects disparate applications. It permits applications to communicate and transfer information to one another and define how they should interact. <br />
    Microservices are pieces of software (with isolated functions) that do a single, tiny, independent part of a bigger application.Microservices have some type of API and are often connected via APIs. <br />
    Most organizations depend heavily on APIs and microservices to build and connect applications, a primary requirement for their digital transformation.</p>

        <p className='text-lg text-center text-gray-600'>Microservices turn the traditional approach to software delivery in a completely new way. Instead of a single massive effort to build, integrate, and test the entire software, a microservices approach allows the same functionalities to be delivered as discrete lightweight services. They interact with the business through a set of well-defined APIs.
        APIs increase the points of presence (PoP) of the products and services. As PoPs increase, it creates the need for an architecture that would scale and enable the incremental delivery of these PoPs. Microservices architectural technique enables web scale architecture and incremental delivery of capabilities.
        In either case, the microservices approach works very well because it enables smaller changes to be delivered incrementally. It thereby speeds up delivery and avoids disruptions in service. As a result, Cloud or SAAS microservice providers can help organizations launch new functionalities and features quickly and easily. As the mobile and browser digital applications have to be exceptionally dynamic and require quick changes, microservices prove to be tremendously valuable here also.</p>
